## About me

Welcome to my academic page! My name is Wei Shen (沈蔚). I am excited to share my journey and research endeavors in the field of artificial intelligence. I am currently a Research Scientist at Skywork AI. Currently. I foucs on RL and Multimodal Agent. Before that I stayed in Baichuan Inc., with a special focus on improving the reasoning capabilities of the Baichuan-series LLMs with [Dong Yan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=lvztRUkAAAAJ).

I completed my bachelor's degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST) in 2020. And I competed my master's degree at Fudan University, working in the NLP Lab under the guidance of [Xuanjing Huang](https://xuanjing-huang.github.io/) as my advisor, with [Tao Gui](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=BrOLQdwAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN)  as my co-advisor.

I am passionate about leveraging language models to enhance various aspects of AI and contribute to the development of advanced and responsible AI systems. 

## Research Interests
My research interests primarily revolve around Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a specific focus on LLM alignment, including reward modeling, RL. Additionally, I am eager to explore the realm of VLM agents and contribute to advancements in that area.
